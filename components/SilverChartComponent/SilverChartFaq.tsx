                Silver bars are frequently referred to as silver bullion;
                however, this is a partial description. Any investment-grade
                silver offered in bars or coins with a purity of at least .995
                or .999 is silver bullion.

                What is a Troy Ounce?

              <AccordionContent className='pt-0 text-base font-normal'>
                A troy ounce is a Middle Ages-era unit of measurement used to
                weigh precious metals. The troy ounce, named after Troyes,
                France, is currently the industry standard for measuring
                precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. A troy ounce
                weighs 31.1034768 grams, more than an avoirdupois pound, which
                weighs 28.3495 grams. About 10% heavier than an avoirdupois
                ounce, the troy ounce is also called "t oz" or "oz t". The
                prices of valuable metals, like the spot prices of gold or
                silver, are usually indicated per troy ounce in international
                markets.

                The price of silver on the spot is constantly changing. Recall
                that there is inherent risk associated with all investments. One
                of the main reasons so many investors hold a portion of their
                portfolio in precious metals like silver and gold is the overall
                favorable historical trend in the spot price. Silver is also an
                excellent hedge against inflation and uncertainty; you may
                reduce risk and counteract more volatile stocks by balancing
                riskier assets with the more reliable silver. One investment
                approach for silver is dollar-cost averaging. It entails
                regularly investing a predetermined sum of money into silver
                over an extended period.
